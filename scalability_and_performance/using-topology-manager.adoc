Topology Manager is a Kubelet component that collects hints from CPU Manager
and Device Manager to align pod CPU and device resources on the same NUMA node.

Topology Manager uses topology information from collected hints to decide if
the pod can be accepted or rejected from the node, based on the configured Topology
Manager Policy and Pod resources requested.

Topology Manager is useful for workloads that desire to use hardware accelerators
to support latency-critical execution and high throughput parallel computation.

Topology Manager is an alpha feature in OCP 4.3.
